      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why are these adorable fuzzies <span class="text-muted">looking for a new home?</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        One of the wonderful things about ferrets is that new things are fun and exciting! That almost always means they don't get upset or stressed out by change. Unlike many other pets, ferrets think a new place to explore is <em>the best!</em>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The problem is that when their humans don't have enough time to give them fun new experiences and things to explore, they get bored and unhappy.

      <p class="lead">
        Chuck & Erica work in tech (thus the website) and love bright colors, mischief, adventures, and monkeyshine. But life is always changing and it just isn't possible to have all the fun all the time.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Chuck & Erica have taken these ferrets everywhere - the park, the beach, wine tasting ... and they have ALL had a fantastic time of it. The problem is that it just hasn't been possible in the past year. The fuzzballs are as happy and playful as ever and they love adventure as much as they ever did. So not being able to take them on adventures or play with them as much makes everyone sad.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        That's why, even though we love them dearly, we want to them to have a new playground and new friends to play with!
